# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to create an easy to use tool which is able to search through UFO sighting data in order to filter the data by specific criteria.  The criteria which were used as filters were date, city, state, country, and ufo shape.  After the javascript webapp was created which could perform the analysis, the tool was then added to Github Pages so that the tool can be easily utilized by the end user without the need for them to search through or understand the code within the repository.
